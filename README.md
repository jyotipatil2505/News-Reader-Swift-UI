## Architecture

This project follows the **MVVM** (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern, which helps keep the code modular, maintainable, and testable.

- **Model**: Represents the app data, such as `Article`. It defines the structure of the data and how it can be encoded/decoded.
  
- **View**: SwiftUI views that display the data and handle user interactions. These are responsible for rendering the user interface and responding to user input.
  
- **ViewModel**: Contains the business logic, communicates with the service layer, and provides data to the View. It acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View, managing the state and behavior of the UI.

## Installation

To set up the NewsReader App on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have the latest version of Xcode installed.
- Clone the repository to your local machine.

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jyotipatil2505/News-Reader-Swift-UI.git

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd NewsApp

3. Open the Xcode project:

   ```bash
   open NewsApp.xcodeproj

4. Run the app on a simulator or a physical device by pressing Cmd + R.


## API Integration

The NewsReader app utilizes the [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/) to fetch articles. This integration allows the app to display real-time news updates across various categories.

### Getting Started with NewsAPI

1. **Sign Up for an API Key**: 
   - Visit [NewsAPI.org](https://newsapi.org/) and create an account to obtain your API key. This key is essential for making requests to the API.

2. **Add Your API Key**: 
   - Once you have your API key, open the `APIConfig.swift` file in your project.
   - Replace the placeholder API key with your actual key:


   ```swift
   static let apiKey: String = "YOUR_API_KEY"

### Example API Request

The NewsReader app makes use of the `NewsRepository` class to handle requests to the NewsAPI. 

- Below is an example of how to fetch the top headlines and handle the response.:

   ```swift
   let endpoint = category == .all || category == nil ? Endpoint.topHeadlines() : Endpoint.topHeadlines(category: category?.rawValue)
        APIManager.shared.request(endpoint: endpoint) { (result: Result<NewsResponse, NetworkError>) in
            switch result {
            case .success(let newsResponse):
                completion(.success(newsResponse.articles))
            case .failure(let error):
                print("error :::::: ",error)
                completion(.failure(error))
            }
        }

### Fetching Articles by Category

   To enhance user experience, the NewsReader app allows you to fetch articles filtered by specific categories. You can specify a category when calling the `fetchNews` method in the `NewsService`. 

- Below is an example of how to request articles related to a specific category, such as Business::

   ```swift
   newsService.fetchNews(category: .business) { result in
       switch result {
       case .success(let articles):
           // Use the fetched articles
           print("Business articles: \(articles)")
       case .failure(let error):
           // Handle any errors that occur
           print("Error fetching business articles: \(error.localizedDescription)")
       }
   }
   

### Supported Categories
